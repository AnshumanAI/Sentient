# Filename: start_mcps.ps1
# Place this script in the root of your project (e.g., D:\Documents\cyber\projects\Sentient-New\Code)

.SYNOPSIS
    Starts all or selected MCP (Modular Companion Protocol) servers in separate PowerShell windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the process of launching the various Python-based MCP servers for the Sentient project.
    It locates all MCP server directories, then for each server:
    1. Opens a new, independent PowerShell terminal window.
    2. Sets the title of the new window to the server's name (e.g., "MCP - GMAIL").
    3. Changes the working directory to the 'src' folder.
    4. Activates the Python virtual environment.
    5. Executes the server's main.py using 'python -m'.

.NOTES
    - Ensure you have a virtual environment located at '.\src\server\venv\'.
    - To run this script, you may need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy.
      Open PowerShell as an Administrator and run:
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
#>

# --- Configuration ---
# The script automatically finds all directories inside 'src\server\mcp-hub'.
# You don't need to manually list them here.
