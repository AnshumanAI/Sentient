# Place this script in the root of your project (e.g., D:\Documents\cyber\projects\Sentient-New\Code)

.SYNOPSIS
    Starts all backend services, workers, and the frontend client for the Sentient project.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the startup of all necessary services for local development.
    It launches each service in its own dedicated PowerShell terminal window with a clear title.

    The script handles:
    - Starting databases like MongoDB (as admin).
    - Launching the Redis message broker within the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
    - Dynamically discovering and starting all MCP (Modular Companion Protocol) servers.
    - Activating the Python virtual environment for all backend scripts.
    - Running the Celery worker and beat scheduler for background tasks.
    - Starting the main FastAPI server and the Next.js frontend client.

.NOTES
    - Run this script from your project's root directory.
    - You may need to adjust your PowerShell execution policy to run this script.
      Open PowerShell as an Administrator and run:
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
