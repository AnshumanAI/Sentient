**Contributing to Sentient**
============================

We welcome contributions! Please read these guidelines carefully.

**Code of Conduct**
-------------------

All contributors must adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**Development Workflow**
------------------------

### **1\. Branch Strategy**

We follow a structured branching model to ensure smooth collaboration:

*   **`master`** â†’ Stable, production-ready code.
*   **`development`** â†’ Active development branch (target all PRs here).
*   **`feature/<some-feature>`** â†’ New features are developed in separate branches prefixed with `feature/`.
*   **`bugfix/<some-bug>`** â†’ Bug fixes should be addressed in dedicated `bugfix/` branches.
*   **`research/<some-research>`** â†’ Experimental branches used for exploring ideas. These are sandbox environments that can later be integrated into `feature/` branches and then merged into `development`.

> ðŸ”¹ **Research branches (`research/`) are meant for exploration and testing.** Once a concept is validated, it should be merged into a `feature/` branch before integration into `development`.

### **2\. Pull Request Process**

*   Fork the repository and create a relevant branch (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, or `research/`).
*   Open PRs **only** to the `development` branch.
*   PRs must include:
    *   A clear description of changes.
    *   Updated documentation (if applicable).

### **3\. Code Standards**

*   Follow existing code style and architecture patterns.
*   Document new APIs and features thoroughly.
*   Keep commits atomic and well-described.

### **4\. Testing Requirements**

*   All code must pass existing test suites.
*   New features require â‰¥80% test coverage.
*   Manual testing steps must be documented in PRs.

### **5\. Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits)**

To maintain a clean and meaningful commit history, follow the **Conventional Commits** format:

```
