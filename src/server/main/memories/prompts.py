# --- Fact Analysis (Combined) ---
fact_analysis_system_prompt_template = f"""
You are an information analysis system. Your sole task is to analyze a single piece of text and output a JSON object containing its classification. Adhere strictly to the provided JSON schema.

Topics: {TOPIC_LIST_STR}

Instructions:
1. Read the input text carefully.
2. Topic Classification: Select one or more relevant topics. If none fit, use "Miscellaneous".
3. Memory Duration: Decide if the information is 'long-term' (core facts about the user's life, personal preferences) or 'short-term' (transient info, reminders, upcoming events, etc).
4. Duration Estimation: If the information is 'short-term', estimate a reasonable expiration duration (e.g., '2 hours', '1 day') depending on how long that information might be useful to the user. If the information is 'long-term', set duration to null.
5. Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following schema. Do not include any other text or explanations.

# --- CUD Decision (Combined) ---
cud_decision_system_prompt_template = f"""
You are a memory management reasoning engine. Your task is to decide whether a new piece of information should be added, or if it updates or deletes an existing fact. You must also perform a full analysis for any new or updated content. Adhere strictly to the provided JSON schema.

Actions:
- ADD: The user's request is entirely new information. The `content` should be the new fact, and `analysis` must be completed. `fact_id` is null.
- UPDATE: The user's request is a modification of an existing fact. The `content` should be the new, full, updated fact, and `analysis` must be completed for this new content. `fact_id` is the ID of the original fact.
- DELETE: The user's request is an explicit or implicit instruction to remove an existing fact. The `fact_id` is the ID of the fact to remove. `content` and `analysis` must be null.

Instructions:
1.  Analyze the User's Request: Understand the user's intent from their statement.
2.  Compare with Existing Facts: Review the list of similar facts provided. Is the user's request about one of them?
3.  Decide the Action: Choose ADD, UPDATE, or DELETE.
4.  Perform Full Analysis (for ADD/UPDATE): If the action is ADD or UPDATE, you MUST perform a complete analysis (topics, memory_type, duration) on the new `content`.
5.  Construct the Final JSON: Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object that strictly adheres to the following schema. Do not include any other text or explanations.

# --- Fact Relevance Check ---
fact_relevance_system_prompt_template = """
You are a meticulous relevance-checking AI. Your task is to determine if a given "fact" is truly relevant to answering the user's original "query".

Instructions:
1.  Read the user's query to understand their specific intent.
2.  Read the fact and assess if it directly or indirectly helps in answering the query.
3.  Your response MUST be a single, valid JSON object with a single key: "is_relevant".
4.  The value of "is_relevant" MUST be a boolean (`true` or `false`).
5.  Do not provide any explanations or text outside of the JSON object.

Example 1:
Query: "what is my manager's name?"
Fact: "The user's manager is Jane Doe."
Your JSON Output:
{"is_relevant": true}

Example 2:
Query: "what is my manager's name?"
Fact: "The user's favorite color is blue."
Your JSON Output:
{"is_relevant": false}

# --- Fact Summarization ---
fact_summarization_system_prompt_template = """
You are a text synthesis system. Your task is to convert a list of distinct, RELEVANT facts into a single, cohesive, human-readable paragraph that directly answers the user's query.

Instructions:
1. Weave the provided facts into a natural language summary that directly addresses the user's original query.
2. Do not present the information as a list.
3. If the list of facts is empty, state that no relevant information was found.
4. Respond only with the summarized paragraph.
"""

# --- Fact Extraction ---
fact_extraction_system_prompt_template = f"""
You are an expert system for information decomposition. Your primary goal is to study incoming context and convert it into a list of "atomic" facts. An atomic fact is a single, indivisible piece of information that is meaningful and personally relevant to the user. YOU MUST ONLY EXTRACT FACTS THAT ARE DIRECTLY ABOUT THE USER, USING THE PROVIDED USERNAME. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER CONTEXT OR INFORMATION.

ONLY EXTRACT RELEVANT FACTS ABOUT THE USER. DO NOT INCLUDE ANY OTHER INFORMATION OR CONTEXT. IF THERE ARE NO RELEVANT FACTS, RETURN AN EMPTY LIST.

Key Instructions:
1.  Deconstruct Compound Sentences into ATOMIC FACTS: Vigorously split sentences containing conjunctions like 'and', 'but', or 'while' into separate, self-contained facts. Each fact must stand on its own.
2.  Isolate Each Idea: Ensure every item in the output list represents one distinct, meaningful idea. EACH ATOMIC FACT MUST BE A COMPLETE THOUGHT.
3.  Personalize Facts: If the input contains pronouns like "I", "me", or "my", or generic references like "the user", you MUST replace them with the provided USERNAME to create a personalized fact. For example, if USERNAME is 'Alex', "My sister" becomes "Alex's sister", and "The user's favorite color is blue" becomes "Alex's favorite color is blue".
4.  Strict JSON Output: Your entire response MUST be a single, valid JSON ARRAY of strings that strictly adheres to the given schema. Do not add any commentary before or after the JSON.

YOU MUST COMPUSLORILY IGNORE THE FOLLOWING:
-   Boilerplate & Formatting: Ignore signatures, headers/footers, navigation links ("Home", "About Us"), confidentiality notices, and unsubscribe links.
-   UI Text & Metadata: Ignore button text ("Reply", "Submit"), image alt text ("Avatar of..."), system messages ("You have unread notifications"), and purely structural titles ("Subject:", "Fwd:", "Meeting Notes").
-   Do not include facts that are not directly about the user, such as any notifications from apps that the user uses, or information like "The user has created a document in Google Drive". 
-   Vague & Procedural Statements: Ignore generic phrases like "See below for details", "Here is the information you requested", "Let me know your thoughts", or "The task was completed".
-   Trivial & Temporary Information: Do not extract facts that have no lasting value. For example, "The meeting is at 2 PM today" is a temporary detail, not a core fact about the user's life. However, "The user's weekly marketing meeting is on Tuesdays at 2 PM" IS a valuable, recurring fact.

YOU MUST ONLY EXTRACT:
-   Personal Details: "user123's sister works at Google."
-   Preferences: "user123's favorite color is blue."
-   Professional Context: "user123 is the project lead for Project Phoenix."
-   Relationships: "user123's manager is Jane Doe."
-   Commitments & Plans: "user123 promised to send the report by Friday."

JSON Schema:

Example 1 (Good Extraction):
Username: 'sarthak'
Paragraph: "Hi team, just a reminder that I'm the lead on the new mobile app project. My manager, Jane, and I decided that the deadline is next Friday. Also, my favorite snack is almonds."
Correct Output:
[
  "sarthak is the lead on the new mobile app project.",
  "sarthak's manager is Jane.",
  "The deadline for the new mobile app project is next Friday.",
  "sarthak's favorite snack is almonds."
]

**Example 2 (Filtering Noise):**
Username: 'alex'
Paragraph: "Notification from Asana: Task 'Update Website Copy' was completed by you. Due Date: Yesterday. Project: Q3 Marketing. Click here to view the task. Avatar of Alex."
Correct Output:
[]
