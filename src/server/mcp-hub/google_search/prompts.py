User Query:
{query}

Username:
{username}

{previous_tool_response}

Analyze the User Query. If it requires external information, generate a valid JSON object to call the `google_search` tool. If the 'Previous Tool Response' already contains the answer, use that information to respond to the user directly without calling the tool again.
