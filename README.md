> Sentient is an open-source AI project aimed at bridging the gap between input context and output actions performed by agents. AI Agents heavily rely on input prompts to perform actions. We wish to _eliminate prompting entirely_ making the first big step towards truly autonomous AI that is aligned with a user's goals and can get stuff done without needing to context-switch between multiple apps and typing long prompts.

Sentient has evolved into a powerful web-based platform with a robust set of features designed for deep integration and automation:

### üß† Proactive Context & Learning

Sentient automatically collects information from connected applications like **Gmail** and **Google Calendar**. It extracts relevant context, identifying important facts to remember and also creates plans to tackle action items - without needing to be prompted.

### üìù Memory System

-   **SuperMemory:** Permanent facts about you‚Äîyour preferences, relationships, and key details‚Äîare stored and managed through an integration with **Supermemory**, creating a rich, personalized knowledge base that the agent can update and retrieve from anytime.
-   **Notes & Organizer:** A full-featured organizer allows you to simply write down what's on your mind and have Sentient manage it for you. Sentient can also write to this organizer, giving you updates on what it's doing and more. The organizer also helps you keep track of scheduled and recurring tasks created by Sentient. Any information obtained from your context sources is also populated in the organizer.

### ü§ñ Autonomous Task & Agent System

-   **Generate Plans from Goals:** Sentient can generate detailed plans to execute tasks using connected tools, all from a simple high-level goal.
-   **Asynchronous Execution:** Once approved, tasks are handled **asynchronously** in the background - you can approve as many tasks as you want simultaneously. The executor agent intelligently uses the available tools to complete the plan, providing real-time progress updates.
-   **View & Manage Tasks:** A dedicated **Tasks page** lets you view active, pending, and completed tasks, check their progress, and see the final results.

### üîå Extensive Integrations (MCP Hub)

Our **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** hub allows for a powerful, distributed system of tools. Current integrations include:

-   **Google Suite:** Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Google Slides.
-   **Productivity:** Slack and Notion.
-   **Developer:** GitHub.
-   **Information:** Internet Search (Google Search), News (NewsAPI), Weather (AccuWeather), Google Shopping and Google Maps.
-   **Miscellaneous:** QuickChart for generating charts on the fly.

More tools will be added soon.

### üí¨ Interactive Chat Overlay

A chat interface is available on any page. It allows you to have conversations with Sentient and also use tools like Internet Search, Weather, News and Shopping for any specific queries.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Full Customization & Settings

A central settings page gives you complete control:

-   Connect or disconnect applications with OAuth (for applications supporting OAuth) or manually.
-   Set custom privacy filters to prevent Sentient from processing context containing sensitive information.
-   Configure WhatsApp notifications to stay updated on the go.

### üîí Self-Hostable

The entire platform can be self-hosted and configured to run fully locally. [Check the relevant docs for more info.](https://sentient-2.gitbook.io/docs/getting-started/running-sentient-from-source-self-host)

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

We are constantly working to expand Sentient's capabilities. Here is a glimpse of what's planned for the future:

-   **Make the Web App as feature-rich as possible:** There is a lot that can be improved in the existing webapp.
-   **OS-Level Integration:** Launch native apps for `Windows`, `MacOS`, `Android` and `iOS` that allow for deeper integrations.
-   **Expanded Integrations:** Add support for more popular services, such as the `Microsoft 365 Suite`, `Spotify`, and so on.
-   **Advanced Reasoning & Planning:** Reasoning improvements for the planning and execution pipeline.
-   **Tool-Specific UI:** Enhance the interface with custom UI components for specific tool outputs, such as maps for location-based results.
-   **Custom Tool Integrations:** Let users add any app of their choice.
